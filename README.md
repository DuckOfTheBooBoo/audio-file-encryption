# audio-file-encryption
This is a repository about encrypting an audio file, then use an audio player to play that encrypted audio file.
NOTE: This requires en_key environment variable to work. So please make your own en_key in your environment. It is recommended to generate your own encryption key with Fernet in Python, then put it in the en_key.
